Project Title

A "spoof" site created as a learning project to understand the fundamentals of full-stack web development and the process of hosting a site from scratch. The project uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and provides a foundation for building and deploying a complete web application.
🚀 Features

    User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.

    MongoDB Integration: A NoSQL database to store user data and dynamic content.

    RESTful API: A back-end API built with Express and Node.js to handle requests from the front end.

    React Front End: A responsive and interactive user interface built with modern React.

    Separated Environments: Independent server and client directories for organized development.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Back End

    Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment.

    Express: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

    MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database.

    Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

    jsonwebtoken: For creating and verifying authentication tokens.

    bcryptjs: For hashing passwords to ensure security.

Front End

    React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    React Router DOM: For declarative routing in the React application.

    Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

🏁 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your machine:

    Node.js (and npm)

    MongoDB Community Server

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name

    Install back-end dependencies:

    cd server
    npm install

    Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following:

    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    PORT=5000

    Replace the values with your own.

    Install front-end dependencies:

    cd ../client
    npm install

Running the Application

    Start the back-end server:
    Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.

    npm start

    The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

    Start the front-end client:
    Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory.

    npm start

    The client will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
