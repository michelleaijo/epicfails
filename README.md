# Spoof Site Project

This is a **simple spoof website** created for learning how to deploy static sites on [Render](https://render.com/). The project contains **three files only**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s meant purely for **educational purposes**.

## Files

* `index.html` – The main HTML structure
* `style.css` – Basic styling for the page
* `script.js` – Simple JavaScript for interactive elements

## Features

* Basic HTML layout with a header, content, and footer
* Custom CSS styling
* Simple JS interactions (alerts, button clicks, or dynamic text updates)
* Fully static – ready to deploy on Render or any static hosting

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. All styling and interactions are handled by `style.css` and `script.js`.

## Deployment on Render

1. Sign up for [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Create a new **Static Site**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository containing the three files.
4. Set the **Build Command** to `none` and **Publish Directory** to `/` (root folder).
5. Deploy and open your live spoof site.

## Notes

* This project is for **learning and experimentation only**.
* No server-side logic is included. Everything is client-side.
